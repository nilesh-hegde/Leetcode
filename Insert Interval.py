'''
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.append(newInterval)
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        merged = []
        for interval in intervals:
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
        return merged
